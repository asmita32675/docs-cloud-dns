DNS propagation
===============

After a DNS change (add, delete, or update) is made to a customer's records, it
might take up to a minute for the change to propagate to Rackspace name
servers.  Many changes made simultaneously might take two to three minutes to
propagate. If a new domain is added or an existing domain is deleted, this
change can take up to a few minutes to propagate. Under extremely high load,
propagation times might exceed five minutes when creating or deleting domains.
When name servers for a domain are changed, complete propagation will take
about two days for most domains; this is enforced by the registries.
