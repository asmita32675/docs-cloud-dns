Faults

When an error occurs, the |product name| service returns a fault object
containing an HTTP error response code that denotes the type of error. In the
body of the response, the system will return additional information about the
fault.

The following table lists possible fault types with their associated error
codes and descriptions.

   * - Error type
     - Error code
     - Description
   * - dnsFault
     - 500
     - Generic catch-all. Should not be seen as often as the specific faults
       below. See the details element for more specifics.
   * - serviceUnavailable
     - 503
     - The request could not be processed because back-end services were
       temporarily unavailable. This condition should be temporary. Contact
       support if the error persists.
   * - unauthorized
     - 401
     - The user is not authorized to access the API functionality in question.
       The user may not have authenticated to the API. If the user should have
       access to the API functionality, contact support.
   * - badRequest
     - 400
     - The request is missing one or more elements, or the values of some
       elements are invalid. See the details element or validationErrors
       element for specifics.
   * - itemNotFound
     - 404
     - The back-end services did not find anything matching the Request-URI.
   * - overLimit
     - 413
     - Either the number of entities in the request is larger than allowed
       limits, or the user has exceeded allowable request rate limits. See the
       details element for more specifics. Contact support if you think you
       need higher request rate limits.
   * - itemAlreadyExists
     - 409
     - The back-end services could not complete the request due to a conflict
       with the current state of the resource. Possibly, the user is trying to
       create an entity that already exists. See the details element for
       specifics.
   * - deleteFault
     - 500
     - The back-end services could not successfully delete some of a number of
       entities requested to be deleted. See the failedItems element for
       specifics.
   * - internalServerError
     - 500
     - The back-end services encountered an unexpected condition that prevented
       it from fulfilling the request. See the details element for specifics.

The base of all fault types is ``dnsFault``. From an XML schema perspective,
all API faults are extensions of the base fault type ``dnsFault``. When working
with a system such as JAXB that binds XML to actual classes, ``dnsFault`` can
be used as a catch-all if there is no interest in distinguishing between
individual fault types.

``dnsFault`` has the structure and elements shown below. All other fault
types extend ``dnsFault``. Currently only fault types ``badRequest`` and
``deleteFault`` actually add additional elements to their structure as
compared to the parent ``dnsFault``. These two fault types are described
later.

**Example: Fault response: XML**

.. code::

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
    <dnsFault xmlns="http://docs.rackspacecloud.com/dns/api/v1.0" code="500">
         <message>Main fault</message>
         <details>Error Details</details>
    </dnsFault>


**Example: Fault response: JSON**

.. code::

    {
      "message" : "Main fault",
      "code" : 500,
      "details" : "Error Details"
    }


The error code (``code``) is returned in the body of the response for
convenience. The ``message`` element returns a human-readable message
that is appropriate for display to the end user. The ``details`` element
is optional and may contain information that is useful for tracking down
an error, such as a stack trace. The ``details`` element may or may not
be appropriate for display to an end user, depending on the role and
experience of the end user.

The fault's root element (for example, ``dnsFault``) may change
depending on the type of error. ``badRequest`` fault adds a
``validationErrors`` element that contains a list of error messages for
invalid requests. The first two ``badRequest`` examples show errors when
the request structure is wrong:

**Example: badRequest fault on request structure errors: XML**

.. code::

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
    <badRequest xmlns="http://docs.rackspacecloud.com/dns/api/v1.0" code="400">
         <message>The request could not be processed.</message>
         <details> Unexpected close tag &lt;/domains&gt; expected &lt;/domain&gt;.
         </details>
    </badRequest>


**Example: badRequest fault on request structure errors:
JSON**

.. code::

    {
      "message":"The request could not be processed.",
      "code":400,
      "details":"Unexpected close tag </domains>; expected </domain>."
    }


The next two ``badRequest`` examples show validation errors:

**Example: badRequest fault on validation errors: XML response**

.. code::

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
    <badRequest xmlns="http://docs.rackspacecloud.com/dns/api/v1.0" code="400">
         <validationErrors>
              <messages>Must provide a name for each domain.</messages>
              <messages>null is not a valid domain name.</messages>
         </validationErrors>
    </badRequest>


**Example: badRequest fault on validation errors: JSON response**

.. code::

    {
      "validationErrors":
      {
        "messages":
        [
          "Must provide a name for each domain.",
          "null is not a valid domain name."
        ]
      },
      "code":400
    }


``deleteFault`` adds a ``failedItems`` element that contains details on
entities that could not be deleted:

**Example: Example deleteFault: XML**

.. code::

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
    <deleteFault xmlns="http://docs.rackspacecloud.com/dns/api/v1.0" code="500">
         <message>One or more items could not be deleted.</message>
         <details>See errors list for details.</details>
         <failedItems>
              <fault code="503">
                   <message>The DNS API is currently not available.</message>
                   <details>Domain ID: 123</details>
              </fault>
         </failedItems>
    </deleteFault>


**Example: deleteFault: JSON**

.. code::

    {
        "failedItems":
         {
            "faults":
             [
              {
                "message":"The DNS API is currently not available.",
                "code":503,
                "details":"Domain ID: 123"
              }
             ]
         },
         "message":"One or more items could not be deleted.",
         "code":500,
         "details":"See errors list for details."
    }
