.. _delete-delete-record-v1.0-account-domains-domainid-records-recordid:

Delete record
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

    DELETE /v1.0/{account}/domains/{domainId}/records/{recordId}

Deletes a record from the domain.

.. note::
   This call returns an asynchronous response, as described in
   :ref:`Synchronous and asynchronous responses<cdns-dg-synch-asynch>`.

These calls delete a specified record or multiple records from a specified
domain.

When a record is deleted, any and all record data is immediately purged and is
not recoverable via the API. So on a successful delete, subsequent requests for
the deleted record should return itemNotFound ( ``404`` ).

Transactionally, delete calls behave differently than other calls in that
deletes are never rolled back on exceptions, and multiple deletes in the same
request do not fail as a group. Instead, each delete is attempted even if one
or more fail. The response for a delete request in which one or more items fail
contains information regarding which items failed as well as information
regarding specific issues that caused the failure(s). See the examples that
follow.
