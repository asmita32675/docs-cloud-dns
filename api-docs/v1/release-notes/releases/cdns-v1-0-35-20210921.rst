Environment Changes
*******************

The v1 environment was migrated to the v2 environment. For the most part the v1 contract was kept the same.
The migration did change a few minor details about the contract. The following are the changes:

Ids are no longer just integers
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
As a result of the migration id data type is now of type string. There are now four possible formats.

- Ids as a 32 digit UUID. This is the new v2 format for all ids. example: 94a01109-94d3-44df-ae95-5fb1d94edfd4
- Ids as integers. Applies to migrated v1 zone Ids. example: 123456
- Ids as a record type plus an integer. Applies to migrated v1 record ids. example: A-123456, TXT-123456
- Ids as a 10 digit hexadecimal. Applies to migrated audit Ids. example: 0a1b2c3d4e

Checking Job status
+++++++++++++++++++
Jobs have the possibility of immediately returning a status of COMPLETED whereas previous behavior RUNNING would be returned.
