Resolved issues

- Improved the performance of requests to retrieve subdomains (see the
  :ref:`List subdomains <get-list-subdomains-v1.0-account-domains-domainid-subdomains>`
  and :ref:`Show domain <get-show-domain-v1.0-account-domains-domainid>`
  operations).
- Added support for exporting TXT records that have multiple strings in
  the data field. TXT records that have multiple strings in the data field to
  work around the 255-byte maximum length of a string within a single TXT
  record are now successfully exported.
