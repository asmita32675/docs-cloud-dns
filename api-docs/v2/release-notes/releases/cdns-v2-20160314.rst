Enabling Rackspace Managed DNS (EA) blocks the use of Rackspace Cloud DNS (Production) for 
users of pyrax versions earlier than 1.9.7. To enable accounts for Managed DNS (EA) without 
impacting current pyrax usage in Cloud DNS, participating customers with a workflow that 
depends on the Rackspace pyrax SDK must upgrade to the latest version (1.9.7). Additionally, 
users of Ansible’s Rackspace modules also must upgrade the pyrax dependency before associated 
accounts can be enabled for Managed DNS (EA).
