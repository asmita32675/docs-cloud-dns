Use Managed DNS
===============

The following sections show you how to use managed DNS to create and manage
zones and record sets.

Creating DNS zones (domains)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the examples in this sections to create zones (domains) by using
|apiservice| operations.

The create zone API operation provisions one or more new DNS zones, based on
the configuration defined in the request object. To create a zone, you send a
``POST`` to the ``/zones`` endpoint.

This operation returns an *asynchronous* response. In fact, ``PUT``, ``POST``,
and ``DELETE`` |apiservice| operations are all *asynchronous*, because they
might take some time to process. Therefore they return ``202 ACCEPTED``
responses containing information with a link URL, which allows the progress,
status, or response information of the operation to be retrieved at a later
point in time.

.. note::

   If the request cannot be fulfilled due to insufficient or invalid data, an
   ``HTTP 400`` (Bad Request) error response will be returned with information
   about the nature of the failure in the body of the response. Failures in the
   validation process are non-recoverable and require you to correct the cause
   of the failure and resend the request.


In this case, assume that you want to create a zone by using
``name=example.org``.

..  note::

   When you name a zone, you can use any letter, numbers from 0 to 9, and a
   hyphen. Ensure that you add the final period (.) at the end of your fully
   qualified zone name (for example, ``example1234.com.``).


Choose one of the following methods:

-  :ref:`Creating a zone with the CLI<cli-creating-zone>`
-  :ref:`Creating a zone with cURL<curl-creating-zone>`

.. include:: examples/curl-creating-zone.rst

Getting details about DNS zones (domains)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the ``list zone`` API operation or the ``zone show`` CLI command to get
detailed output for a specific zone by using the ``zone UID``. You can query
only zones that you have permission to query, which are ones created using your
tenant ID.

Choose one of the following methods:

-  :ref:`Getting details about a zone with the CLI<cli-listing-zone>`
-  :ref:`Getting details about with cURL<curl-listing-zone>`

Create record sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A record set groups together a list of related records of the same type. It is
the essential content of your zone file. Record sets are also referred to as
*Resource Record Sets* or *RRSets*. The following examples create an A record
set. An A record set is used to map a hostname to an IP address.

Choose one of the following methods:

-  :ref:`Creating a record set with the CLI<cli-creating-recordset>`
-  :ref:`Creating a record set with cURL<curl-creating-recordset>`

.. include:: examples/cli-creating-recordset.rst
.. include:: examples/curl-creating-recordset.rst

Get details about record sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the ``list record set`` API operation or the ``recordset show`` CLI command
to get detailed output for a specific record set by using the ``recordset id``.

Choose one of the following methods:

-  :ref:`Getting details about a record set with the CLI<cli-listing-recordset>`
-  :ref:`Getting deatils about a record set with cURL<curl-listing-recordset>`
